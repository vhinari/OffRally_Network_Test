Upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1
------------------------------------------------------
PLEASE backup your work before attempting this journey. While every attempt has been made to ensure it works, you never know.
Any issues, comments or suggestions please send to  me at email@jasperstocker.com

Overview of Process
------------------------------------------------------
Backup your project now! :o)
First you need to not upgrade to 1.1. Keep your project at version 1.0
Email me with your invoice number and I can provide you with some new scripts for 1.0
These new scripts add an XML export option to the options menu (the cog)
Once you've got an XML file exported, now upgrade to 1.1
1.1 has an import option in the new export menu (last menu item)
You can create a new track and then use the import to bring your 1.0 track in
DONE! It should keep all your textures intact. Email me if you have any issues

------------------------------------------------------
Why is this so damn complicated?!
------------------------------------------------------
Yeah, really sucks. I'm sorry, but it's the best way to get an upgrade path from 1.0 to 1.1.
1.1 has been slightly rebuilt in the core and there was no way I could keep backwards compatibility.
The new Undo system Unity brought in with 4.3 has necessitated this along with serialisation issues it's had with using ScriptableObjects
They are the devil - keep away from them! ;o)
The new version fully supports prefabs and copy pasting now though so there is a bonus!
Hope you enjoy
